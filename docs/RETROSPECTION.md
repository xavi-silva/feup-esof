## Sprint 1 (16/04/2024)

### Participants
- Miguel Fernandes
- Pedro Gon√ßalo Oliveira
- Pedro Marinho
- Rui Xavier Silva
- Tomas Vinhas

### What Went Well
- Successfully solved some annoying bugs and errors;
- Database is receiving data appropriately despite some difficulties;
- Most main pages are almost fully implemented.

### What Could Have Gone Better
- We should start working on the sprint earlier so that we don't get overwhelmed in the last few days doing things in a hurry;
- Sometimes we got stuck too much time on a problem and ended up being a lot less productive than what would be expected.

### What Puzzles Us
- We are having some issues with the user's authentication on Firebase;
- Sending data from the app to the database is taking us some time to understand.

### What are we going to do to improve
- Organize the sprint on the first class of the sprint;
- Start working on the sprint right on the day after the first class of the sprint;
- Avoid spending several hours solving a problem, asking for help after not succeeding in a couple tries;
- Use FlutterFlow to help building the layouts of the pages.

### Summary
- From a general point of view, in this sprint we are a little disappointed that we weren't able to do as many things as we would like, because we had a lot of problems that took us more time than what would be desirable, which slowed down the development of the application;

- Looking at the overall perspective of the project, we are optimistic and confident that in the next sprints we won't be facing as many problems as in this one, once it was our first time dealing with flutter and dart.

## Sprint 2 (30/04/2024)

### What Went Well
- Unlike in sprint #1, we managed our time pretty well and were able to finish our sprint earlier then we expected;
- Coding was easier then in the previous sprint, due to the fact that we are now more familiar with dart and flutter.
### What Could Have Gone Better
- There were a couple times where we had to almost fully restructure our code due to confusing logic in our implemenation;
- Some changes on the database forced us to make many changes on the code, and that ended up taking us too much time.
### What Puzzles Us
- Sometimes the pages take some time to load and we are still wondering whether we should try to decrease that time by improving our code structure or add a loading icon while the page is not ready to be displayed.

### What are we going to do to improve
- Make a plan before jumping right into coding, where we ponder if our code structure will be easy to understand and easy to adapt;
- Analyze our database carefully before starting the sprint to check if there are any necessary changes.

### Summary 
- From an overall perspective, this sprint went pretty well and we are happy that we managed to implement everything that was added to the sprint backlog. Besides that, we were also capable of matching the action points of the last sprint, which is always a sign that we are on the right path.

## Sprint 3 + Release (22/05/2024)

### What Went Well
- Once we have made a lot of progress on sprint #2, we were left with way less work on this one, which allowed us to have a less overwhelming sprint and as a consequence more time to polish our product.

### What Could Have Gone Better
- In spite of having plenty of time to implement every Sprint Backlog task, we still end up postponing our work until the last few days due to external reasons.

### Summary 
- In general, sprint #3 advanced smoothly. Besides some previously discarded user stories, we implemented all the remaining features for the final delivery, refactored our code and corrected every known issue of SweepSpot.

### Final Review
- From an overall perspective, we managed to implement every scheduled feature excluding issue [#9](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2023-24/2LEIC14T4/issues/9) which we chose not to implement.
- In the beggining we didn't match our expectations as a consequence of our poor time management. However, we quickly improved our team work and a few weeks later went back on track.
- Now that the app is finished and ready to release, we are proud and can confidently say we did a good job. From our point of view, the final result is a bug-free well designed app that meets the requirements of this curricular unit.
- Finally, the pitch and its positive feedback we received from our collegues was the cherry on top.
